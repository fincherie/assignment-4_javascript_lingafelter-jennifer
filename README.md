# Assignment 4
>"I have read the Coe Requirements Reference Sheet. My code follows the requirements"

## Resources
The list of resources is every Google search for functions, variables, arrays, function expressions, etc.  I had difficulties understanding the terms and concepts and putting them into practice because they seemed to contradict one another (see Comments below for more).
However, the main resources I used for functions and arrays were:
JavaScript: A Beginner's Guide, John Pollock
Javascript & JQuery, Jon Buckett

I also relied on https://www.w3schools.com/ and https://www.lynda.com/ for examples of functions and arrays.

## Deductions & Comments
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.
This assignment was difficult in the sense that I haven't had a lot of practice with JavaScript and so putting the concepts into practice was challenging; however, helpful in the end.  What I'm learning in this class is that things are difficult to understand in the beginning but after practicing the new concepts, it becomes easier and I even understand it!
I found it very helpful to attempt writing the code for the arrays and functions and then having you explain what I was doing and how it needed to be fixed.  That helped me to understand the thought process behind the functions.
